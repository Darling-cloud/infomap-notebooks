# Installing python 3.X

To complete the hands-on exercises, you will need a working `python 3.x` environment running on an operating system of your choice. For Windows, MacOS, and Linux users we recommend [Anaconda 5.2](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution, an OpenSource `python` 3.6 distribution that comes pre-configured for data science and machine learning tasks.


## Setting up InfoMap

`Infomap` is written in C++ but includes a python interface. The easiest way to install it is via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/infomap/):

```
pip install infomap
```

If you are running on Windows 10, the simplest way to get the compilation tools needed to complete the installation is to [install the Ubuntu bash](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). This will set up a Linux subsystem on your Windows machine. After you have installed the distribution, start the Ubuntu bash terminal and run the command above.

For more detailed information about the installation and usage of `Infomap` see [www.mapequation.org/code.html](http://www.mapequation.org/code.html).
